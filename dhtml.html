	<h1>DHTML : </h1>

	<p>DHTML stands for Dynamic HTML, it is totally different from HTML. The browsers which support the dynamic HTML are some of the versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer of version higher than 4.0. The DHTML is based on the properties of the HTML, javascript, CSS, and DOM (Document Object Model which is used to access individual elements of a document) which helps in making dynamic content. It is the combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and DOM. The DHTML make use of Dynamic object model to make changes in settings and also in properties and methods. It also makes uses of Scripting and it is also part of earlier computing trends.

	DHTML allows different scripting languages in a web page to change their variables, which enhance the effects, looks and many others functions after the whole page have been fully loaded or under a view process, or otherwise static HTML pages on the same. But in true ways, there is noting that as dynamic in DHTML, there is only the enclosing of different technologies like CSS, HTML, JS, DOM, and different sets of static languages which make it as dynamic.

	DHTML is used to create interactive and animated web pages that are generated in real-time, also known as dynamic web pages so that when such a page is accessed, the code within the page is analyzed on the web server and the resulting HTML is sent to the clientâ€™s web browser.</p>

	<h1>Advantages : </h1>
	<p>
		Size of the files are compact in compared to other interactional media like Flash or Shockwave, and it downloads faster.
		It is supported by big browser manufacturers like Microsoft and Netscape.
		Highly flexible and easy to make changes.
		Viewer requires no extra plug-ins for browsing through the webpage that uses DHTML, they do not need any extra requirements or special software to view it.
		User time is saved by sending less number of requests to the server. As it is possible to modify and replace elements even after a page is loaded, it is not required to create separate pages for changing styles which in turn saves time in building pages and also reduces the number of requests that are sent to the server.
		It has more advanced functionality than a static HTML. it is capable of holding more content on the web page at the same time.
	</p>

	<h1>Disadvantages : </h1>
	<p>
		It is not supported by all the browsers. It is supported only by recent browsers such as Netscape 6, IE 5.5, and Opera 5 like browsers.
		Learning of DHTML requires a lot of pre-requisites languages such as HTML, CSS, JS, etc should be known to the designer before starting with DHTML which is a long and time-consuming in itself.
		Implementation of different browsers are different. So if it worked in one browser, it might not necessarily work the same way in another browser.
		Even after being great with functionality, DHTML requires a few tools and utilities that are some expensive. For example, the DHTML text editor, Dreamweaver. Along with it the improvement cost of transferring from HTML to DHTML makes cost rise much higher.
